Courses that I teach at the [University of Nebraska - Lincoln](www.unl.edu).

# [NRES 315: Human Dimensions of Wildlife and Fisheries](https://bulletin.unl.edu/courses/NRES/315)


{% include feature_row %}

Managers and researchers increasingly must contend with the problem of understanding and managing complex, social-ecological systems.
To be effective in the job requires understanding how people value, experience, use, care for, interact with, and are sustained by the natural environment.Â 

This course provides an introduction to the theory and methods necessary to understand human dimensions as well as applications and case studies of human dimensions in fisheries and wildlife management.

# [Special topics using R](https://bulletin.unl.edu/courses/NRES/898)

{% include feature_row id="feature_row2" %}

I teach a Special Topics course every semester that covers aspects of using the R statistical language.  We have covered a wide variety of topics including Ecological Detective, applied mutlivariate statitics, regression, ecological simulations, building Shiny apps, data wrangling, and graphics. While graduate students take this for credit, the group is open to faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and agency personnel.  I keep all the lessons in a github repository with its own [project page](https://chrischizinski.github.io/SNR_R_Group/).
